# Ticket Lifecycle

## Lab Overview
#### In this lab I will be covering the following:
* SLAs and why they are important
* How to triage a ticket
* Escalating a ticket
* And closing a ticket

## SLAs (Service Level Agreement)
#### SLAs is what gives the help desk structure. It's a set of guidelines that tell agents how long they have to work on the tickets inside the queue. The most important SLA is Time-to-resolution (TTR) this tells based on what the ticket category is how much time you have to complete the ticket. In the photo below is an example of preset SLAs for my lab environment. We have 4 hours TTR for Incidents, 8 hours for Service Requests, and 40 hours for Post-incident reviews.

## Triage Tickets
#### Ticket triage is basically before working the ticket you're reviewing the information inside it to see if you either have enough information to work the ticket or to see where the ticket needs to go. In the screenshot below is an example of an open ticket. If you are able to work the ticket with the information you have assign it to yourself.

If you need more information to get started on the ticket you can go to the bottom of the ticket and click on "Reply to Customer" and ask for more information. And change the ticket to "Pending". And waiting for a response will pause the SLA. If you do have enough information make sure the ticket is assigned to yourself and contact the user however they want to be contacted. Make sure you're documenting inside the ticket comments while assissting the user.

## Escalating a ticket
#### Some tickets are immediately escalated depending on factors of Prioritization or Critical System issues. As the person escalating the ticket you need to provide as much information as possible to the agent you are sending the ticket to. Also let the user who sent in the ticket know that someone else will be assisting them with the issue. Also let the assignee know why you're escalating the ticket. You escalate tickets by assigning it to an agent you know handle those complex issues. To actually escalate you go to the assignee tab and type in the name of the agent who the ticket is meant for. The screenshot below shows the empty assignee block where you type in the escalated agents name.

## Closing a ticket
#### You only close a ticket once the user has confirmed the issue is resolved. Pre-maturely closing tickets can cause issues and clog up the flow of new tickets entering the queue. To simply close a ticket go to the top right corner of the open ticket it should currently be "In-Progress". Click on that and change to "Resolved" Example is in the screenshot below.

And thats completes this lab, for profeciency repeat this as many times as necessary.
